# Team AccessDenied project README

- python dependencies to install
  - tensorflow
  - jupyterlab
  - matplotlib
  - pandas
  - pefile
  - pyqt5
- file explanation:
  1. `1dcnn.ipynb` contains the code for preprocessing and training of the 1D CNN model
     - model weights are saved to `data/saved_models/model1`
  2. `predict.py` takes a command line argument that gives the path of the executable
     that needs to be scanned for malware
     - it outputs the individual class probabilities and most probable class of malware
     - if the executable has previously been scanned and stored in the whitelist,
      the prediction code is shortcircuited for faster execution
  3. `library.c` contains code for modification of environment initialization function `__libc_start_main`
     - change the absolute path of the `predict.py` script in the `C` file before compiling
     - compile using `cc -fPIC -shared -Wall -W -Wno-parentheses library.c -o library.so -ldl`
     - this code calls the `predict.py` script to make sure that the executable is benign
  4. `main.py` contains the python code for the GUI application that takes an executable
     file and checks it for malware

# training

- execute the `1dcnn.ipynb` jupyter notebook with the data in the following directory structure:
  - data/
    - train/
      - bytes files

# testing on linux

- to execute on linux, use the following command:

  ```
  $ LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/library.so /path/to/executable
  ```

  - example command: `LD_PRELOAD=./library.so /bin/ls -l`

# running the windows GUI application

- execute `python3 main.py` on the windows console with the directory structure as given in the zip file
